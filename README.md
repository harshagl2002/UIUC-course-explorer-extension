# UIUC-course-explorer-extension
Chrome extension for courses.illinois.edu - the official course exploring website of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign

The current course explorer website allows users to search for a particular major but not a specific course. In addition, users can not search for a particular term as well.

This extension allows students to search for specific courses along with allowing them to search for a particular term of any year, beginning 2004. It also enhances user experience by allowing them to search for any major for any particular term or any specific course for a given term.

Further, the extension also attaches a hyperlink to the location of the place where the course is taught, thus allowing the users to navigate to the required location easily.
